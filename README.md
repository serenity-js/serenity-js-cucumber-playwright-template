This [**template repository**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) helps you automate testing
of web applications using [**Serenity/JS**](https://serenity-js.org), [**Cucumber**](https://cucumber.io/), and [**Playwright**](https://playwright.dev/),
and comes pre-configured with **TypeScript**, linting, reporting, and example test scenarios.

Use this template to accelerate your test automation setup
and generate [Serenity BDD living documentation](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/).

View live reports generated by this template:
- [Serenity BDD living documentation](https://serenity-js.github.io/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template/)

## Features

- Pre-configured **Serenity/JS** + **Cucumber** + **Playwright** + **TypeScript** setup
- Example BDD scenarios demonstrating web application testing
- **Screenplay Pattern** implementation showcasing reusable tasks and interactions
- Integrated reporting with **Serenity BDD** living documentation
- ESLint configuration for code quality and consistency
- CI-ready scripts and development environment support
- Ready-to-use GitHub Codespaces environment using the official [Serenity/JS Docker image](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/integration/docker/)

## Quick Start

### Explore instantly in GitHub Codespaces

Launch this project in an online development environment:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?ref=main&repo=serenity-js/serenity-js-cucumber-playwright-template)

### Run locally

#### 1. Prerequisites

Follow the [Serenity/JS installation guide](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/about/installation/) to set up your development environment with the following prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Java JRE 17+](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-glance.html)

#### 2. Create your project

[Create a new GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) from this template and
[clone it](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your machine:

```shell
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-project>
```

#### 3. Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies and [Playwright browsers](https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers):

```shell
npm ci
npx playwright install
```

##### Corporate networks

If your environment requires proxy configuration or an internal registry like Artifactory or Nexus, add an [`.npmrc` file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/npmrc) file
with the appropriate configuration to your home directory:

```
proxy=http://user:password@host.mycompany.com:8080/
https-proxy=http://user:password@host.mycompany.com:8080/
strict-ssl=false
registry=https://artifactory.mycompany.com/artifactory/
```

#### 4. Run tests

Run the example tests:
```
npm test
```

#### 5. View reports

View the Serenity BDD report generated under the following path:

- **Serenity BDD**: `./target/site/serenity/index.html`

Alternatively, serve the Serenity BDD report using the built-in HTTP server,
accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080):
```
npm run start
```

## Execution

The project provides several [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/scripts) defined in [`package.json`](package.json):

```
npm run lint            # runs code linter
npm run lint:fix        # attempts to automatically fix linting issues
npm run clean           # removes reports from any previous test run
npm test                # executes the example test suite
                        # and generates the report under ./target/site/serenity
npm start               # starts a mini HTTP server and serves the test reports
                        # at http://localhost:8080
```

### Test execution modes

```shell
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific feature file
npx cucumber-js features/authentication/form-based_authentication.feature

# Run tests with specific tags
npx cucumber-js --tags "@smoke"

# Run tests in headed mode (see the browser)
HEADLESS=false npm test

# Run tests with different configuration
npx cucumber-js --profile <profile-name>
```

## Project Structure

The template follows a clear structure to help you organize your tests:

```
features/
├── authentication/
│   └── form-based_authentication.feature  # Example BDD scenarios
├── step-definitions/                      # Cucumber step definitions
│   ├── parameter.steps.ts                 # Custom parameter types
│   └── the-internet.steps.ts              # Step definitions for test scenarios
└── support/
    └── serenity.config.ts                 # Serenity/JS configuration

test/                                      # Screenplay Pattern implementations
├── Actors.ts                              # Actor configuration with abilities
├── authentication/                        # Example authentication-related tasks
│   ├── Authenticate.ts
│   └── VerifyAuthentication.ts
└── examples/
    └── PickExample.ts                     # Example navigation tasks

cucumber.js                                # Cucumber profile configuration
target/site/serenity/                      # Generated Serenity BDD reports
```

**Key files:**
- `features/*.feature` - Test scenarios using Gherkin syntax (Given/When/Then)
- `features/step-definitions/` - Cucumber step definitions connecting Gherkin to implementation
- `test/` - Tasks, questions, and abilities following the [Screenplay Pattern](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/)

## Next steps

- Replace the example tests with your own
- Add new tasks, interactions, and assertions using Serenity/JS
- Extend the test suite or integrate it into CI/CD pipelines
- Use the sample reports to understand expected testing and reporting workflows

## Troubleshooting

### Playwright browsers not installed

If you see errors about browsers not being installed, run:
```shell
npx playwright install
```

### Port 8080 already in use

If the report server fails to start because port 8080 is in use, you can specify a different port:
```shell
npx http-server -p 3000 target/site/serenity -s -o
```

### Java not found error

Serenity BDD reports require Java 17 or higher. Verify your installation:
```shell
java -version
```

If Java is not installed, download it from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or use a package manager:
- **macOS**: `brew install openjdk@17`
- **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install openjdk-17-jre`
- **Windows**: Download from Oracle or use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/): `choco install openjdk17`
